# ComfyUI-Nodes

A collection of nodes for ComfyUI.

The nodes are mainly used for my own projects, so they may not be very useful for you. But I am open to suggestions and pull requests.

Many of the JSON-Files are generated with ChatGPT, so they may not be perfect. If you want to improve or extend them, feel free to do so. But I would appreciate it if you would share your changes with me.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Move it to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder
3. Restart ComfyUI
